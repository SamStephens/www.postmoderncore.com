Postmoderncore is proud to release the second volume of the Dada Songwriting Compilation, [spooky mallet Resonance Knifespoon](/albums/spooky-mallet-resonance-knifespoon). Many thanks to [Corporal Tofulung](https://www.mixcloud.com/corporaltofulung/) for mixing and producing the album.

As with Volume 1 of the Dada Songwriting project, [Rejection dryrot ripple Gombage](/albums/rejection-dryrot-ripple-gombage), each contributor created two mins of raw sound - a single track recorded live with no post-processing. After each set of four submissions arrived, they were blindly put together to create a track - as and when they arrived in Corporal Tofulung's inbox.
