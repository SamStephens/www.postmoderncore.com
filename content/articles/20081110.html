Zombie Prom Queen will be playing at Stinkfest, a three day event from 11-13 December, celebrating the tenth anniversary of Stink Magnetic. Stink Magnetic and Postmoderncore have always been connected, so it's great to be able to play at this, and celebrate Stink Magnetic's success. Too many great acts to list here, but a reunion of Voodoo Savage and His Savages, and a Slim Chants outing are worth mentioning.
