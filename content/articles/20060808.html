<p>
The first "studio" recordings available from <a href="/artists/the-shambolics">The Shambolics</a>, this album has been waiting since September 2004 for Totally Obsessed By Skulls Studios to finally whip this recording into shape. Bad music for bad people by shambolic skeletons. shamblus in extremis excelsis.
