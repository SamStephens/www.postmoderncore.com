[Tangent](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22tangent%22) will be performing a set of live improvised cutup at electronic music series Skronktronic. Tangent doesn't perform often, so don't miss this unusual performance.

The Oneirologist always has a great line up at these shows, I'm looking forward to seeing the other performers.

New River Studios is at Ground Floor Unit E, 199 Eade Road, N4 1DN London. There's a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2384171754927063/).
