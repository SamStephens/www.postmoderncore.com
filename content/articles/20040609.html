<p>I've had some art works accepted for the Vent (4) group exhibition at the Thermostat Gallery
in Palmerston North (in New Zealand). It's based around digital art work. The
exhibition runs between 26th June and 15th July, with the opening on Sat the 26th June
5:30-7:30pm - come and say hi and eat and drink for free if you're in the area
(Thermostat is on the 1st floor of 186-187 The Square)
