This is the last set of releases before I go to Korea. There are ten new albums available. Two of these releases are by <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22jeff+henderson%22">Jeff Henderson</a>. Jeff is an integral part of the New Zealand improvised music scene. He is one of the true master saxophonists; the founder of important venues for Wellington music; he has played with many great musicians such as Evan Parker and Han Bennink. Now postmoderncore is releasing Jeffs first two solo albums, <a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc045">A</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc044">Fuck You You Bureaucratic Fucks</a>. Each of them is a recording of one of Jeffs live improvisations on baritone saxophone, and both of them are astounding pieces of music.
