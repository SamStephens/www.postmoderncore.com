A new album by the [Unknown Rockstar](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22unknown+rockstar%22), [Bare Winter Trees](https://archive.org/details/pmc086) is a longform guitar improvisation. Spiralling, steely, overtone rich guitar lines and loops create a variety of cold, metallic, but murky spaces. Emotions, sentimentality and the odd surprise arise.
