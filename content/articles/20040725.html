You can now buy CD-Rs of all the music on the postmoderncore catalog, with jewel cases and high quality front and back covers. You can pay using your credit card, through Paypal. The standard price is US$13 per CD, including postage and packaging. The mp3s are still available for free download, and the cover art is still viewable in the cover gallery.
