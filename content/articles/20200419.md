[Tangent](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22tangent%22) has released a new album of confusion and interest, [World's Worst Bootlegs 2011-2017](https://archive.org/details/pmc084). Seven years in the making.

How are these bootlegs the worst? Where did they come from? Why inflict them upon the world?
