Happy, on the corner of Tory and Vivien Streets, Wellington

Postmoderncore brings you Deep Earplug Music 01, the first in a long running series of gigs. Our initial focus is accoustic feedback - feedback that involves the actual vibration of physical objects. Guitars leaned up against amplifiers, microphones wailing, and other light entertainment. We intend to provide sonic investigations for often uncatered to palettes. Our guests for the first night are Jonny Marks, The Unknown Rockstar, and grv dgr. Starts at 8:30pm sharp so be there on time, have a chat to the artists, and have a good time. Earplugs for sale on the night.
