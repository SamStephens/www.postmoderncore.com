Arena II is a 24 hour festival which goes from 0:00-23:59 GMT+0 on the 12th of October, with one performer each hour. It is organised by <a href="http://nomusic.org">nomusic</a>. It looks to be a good festival. The names I recognise on the playlist are <a href="http://www.tapegerm.com/">Tapegerm Collective</a> and <a href="http://www.audioh.com/">Janek Schaefer</a>. I'm sure the others will be well worth checking out also.
