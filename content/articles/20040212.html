<p>
The crew at <a href="http://www.pressthebutton.com">Press the Button</a> have created a new piece, "A Rick Jensen Reverie" entirely from samples of the <a href="http://www.postmoderncore.com/artists/the-rick-jensen-trio">Rick Jensen Trio</a>. It's an impressive transformation, a original piece that is quite reminiscent of the original performance but also completely different. Get it from the Sound page on the Press the Button website.
