<p>
The long awaited "<a href="http://www.freespeechforsale.com">Free Speech For Sale</a>" has now been released, featuring a track, "Hallo", from Postmoderncore's own <a href="/artists/cyberphobe">Cyberphobe</a>, as well as contributions from <a href="http://evolution-control.com">The Evolution Control Committee</a>, <a href="http://www.animalswithinanimals.com">Animals Within Animals</a>, <a href="http://www.pressthebutton.com">The Button</a>, and other great sound artists. Much kudos to the <a href="http://www.pressthebutton.com">Everyman</a>, and all those who contributed tracks, time and money to this project. Check it out, it's something interesting and somewhat unique.

<a href="/artists/cyberphobe">Cyberphobe</a> has also promised me we'll get some more music on his page in the next week or two... geography makes getting material off him trickier than it used to be.
