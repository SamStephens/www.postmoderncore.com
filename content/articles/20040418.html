Due to the privacy invasion side of the stolen art galleries, I have decided to take them down. Some have emailed me saying the galleries were a good thing because "Disabusing the audience of notions of privacy is a public service." While I do agree with this, I think I don't need the galleries themselves to educate, and the exhibition is too potentially harmful.
