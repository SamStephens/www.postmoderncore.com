<p>Postmoderncore is really excited to welcome a new artist to the roster, <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22death+masks%22">Death Masks</a>. Their first album for Postmoderncore is <a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc075">Black as a Color</a>. "The world this piece intends to create is shrouded in spectral lights and abysmal darkness, it is a world caught between bestial cruelty and yearning sentimentality.".</p>
