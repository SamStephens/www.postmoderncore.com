<p>Postmoderncore is really excited to welcome a new artist to the roster, <a href="/artists/death-masks">Death Masks</a>. Their first album for Postmoderncore is <a href="/albums/black-as-a-color">Black as a Color</a>. "The world this piece intends to create is shrouded in spectral lights and abysmal darkness, it is a world caught between bestial cruelty and yearning sentimentality.".</p>
