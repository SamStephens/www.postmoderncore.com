thumbnail_title: Major website overhaul
---
I've just completed a major simplification of the Postmoderncore website. It now only hosts the news articles.
All music should now be obtained by going to the [Internet Archive's Postmoderncore collection](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date).

Our music has always been hosted at the Internet Archive, but previously I had artist and album pages with players and download links on this website
as well. In order to simplify my life I've now removed these pages.
