<p>i've had the privilege to design and host the website for a CD compilation that has recently been released in Wellington, New Zealand - <a href="http://www.saladbones.co.nz">salad bones</a>. it's a CD of spoken word with music. five poets have collaborated with five musicians, entrusting the musicians with open artistic license. the result is quite varied, a small slice into some scenes that are going on in this city. i've not come across anything quite like it.
