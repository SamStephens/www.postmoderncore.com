<p>
Lots of new releases from <a href="/artists/tangent-precipitate">Tangent Precipitate</a> over the last few months ranging over widely varying sound palettes, and an overdue excursion from <a href="/artists/starcrusher">Starcrusher</a> brings drone, randomness, and power to fuck with your head, on "<a href="/albums/afternoon-and-evening">Afternoon and Evening</a>". And the just uploaded <a href="stolenartgallery.html">Stolen Art Gallery</a> is an exhibition of peoples digital photos filched off their computers using person to person file sharing.</p>
