Lots of new releases from <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22tangent+precipitate%22">Tangent Precipitate</a> over the last few months ranging over widely varying sound palettes, and an overdue excursion from <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22starcrusher%22">Starcrusher</a> brings drone, randomness, and power to fuck with your head, on "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc030">Afternoon and Evening</a>". And the just uploaded <a href="stolenartgallery.html">Stolen Art Gallery</a> is an exhibition of peoples digital photos filched off their computers using person to person file sharing.</p>
