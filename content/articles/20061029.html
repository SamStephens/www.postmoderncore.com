Zombie Prom Queen plays what should be a really exciting gig. They've been working on their nasty trash rock sludge, and look forward to playing alongside such a great line up: the psych rock brain frying groove of The Idle Suite, mad, detuned, messed up county with Cletus, and unknown electronic sounds from Moonland Muzak.
