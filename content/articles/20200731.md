The fantastic Liquid Library have just released the self-titled album [Ghost Violin](https://liquidlibrary.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-violin), a collaboration between [Ivy Nostrum](https://nostrumivy.bandcamp.com/) and Postmoderncore's own [Unknown Rockstar](/artists/unknown-rockstar). "Ethereal clutter, bizzaro frequencies and will o the wisp noise". "Junk grumble, angst scuzz, headache drifts. Smooth!".
