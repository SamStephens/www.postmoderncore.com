Due to a new hosting arrangement, shortly all the albums on postmoderncore will be available for direct download from this website - making downloading easy, dl manager friendly, and high speed. Also the "<a href="http://www.freespeechforsale.com">Free Speech for Sale</a>" CD (<small>featuring <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22cyberphobe%22">Cyberphobe</a></small>) is finished, and the last of the art is just being done before the release is ready (as I understand). Also rumour has it an album by <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22cyberphobe%22">Cyberphobe</a> may be coming out; and that the <a href="stolenartgallery.html">Stolen Art Gallery</a> may have another set of art added to it. Keep watch for more news, music and surprises.<br>
<small>I don't currently provide streaming links, although you could copy the mp3 download links and paste them into your player to stream them. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you would find streaming links useful.</small></p>
