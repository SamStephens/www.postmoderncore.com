Postmoderncore is proud to release the first volume of the Dada Songwriting Compilation, [Rejection dryrot ripple Gombage](/albums/rejection-dryrot-ripple-gombage). Many thanks to [Corporal Tofulung](https://twitter.com/GinOnDiamonds) for mixing and producing the album.

Each contributor created two mins of raw sound - a single track recorded live with no post-processing. After each set of four tracks arrived, they were blindly put together to create each track - as and when they arrived in [Corporal Tofulung's](https://twitter.com/GinOnDiamonds) inbox.

The levels were adjusted so that quiet tracks could be heard. Otherwise there was no post production.

EDIT: A second album is has been released, [spooky mallet Resonance Knifespoon](/albums/spooky-mallet-resonance-knifespoon).
