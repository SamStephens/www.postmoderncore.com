<p>I've put a <a href="http://dadashopping.net/work.php?code=photo_gallery_2004_may">gallery of photos</a> online.
They are a selection from a collection of photos I took while I was borrowing a friends
digital camera.
</p>
<p>I've also put up another obscurity, the <a href="cattunnel.gif">Cat Tunnel</a>. This
disturbing animated GIF is based on <a href="http://www.infinitecat.com/">The Infinite Cat Project</a>
pictures...
</p>
<p>
<small><b>Update:</b> The photos have been moved to <a href="http://dadashopping.net/work.php?code=photo_gallery_2004_may">dadashopping.net</a></small>
