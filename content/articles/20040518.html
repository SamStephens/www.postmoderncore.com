<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22unknown+rockstar%22">Unknown Rockstar</a> has producted a first album, <a href="/albums/sound-board">sound board</a>, an album of beautiful, relatively sparse instrumental playing, on acoustic and electric guitar and on clarinet. The instrumental methods and modes developed through the <a href="/albums/wood-brass-nylon">Tangent Precipitate</a> era are bought to a more focused conception of improvisation and sound under the guise of this new persona.
