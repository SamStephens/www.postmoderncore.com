[iiii Records](https://iiiirecords.bandcamp.com) have been releasing adventurous improv music from Aotearoa for a number of years now. [Tangent](/artists/tangent) was privileged to be invited to play with a stellar group of musicians, [Snouts!](https://www.discogs.com/artist/7237392-The-Snouts-2) and [Mette Rasmussen](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1735790-Mette-Rasmussen) for a set at the [Audio Foundation](http://www.audiofoundation.org.nz/) on 19 January 2018. iiii Records described this as "a jagged set of cut-up, brain melting sclorp".

Sadly the guitarist of Snouts!, Phill Dryson, is no longer with us. To commemorate the third anniversary of his passing, iiii Records have released [Snouts! with Mette Rasmussen & Tangent](https://iiiirecords.bandcamp.com/album/snouts-with-mette-rasmussen-tangent) as part of a rememberance for him.
