<p>
<a href="/artists/the-rick-jensen-trio">Rick Jensen</a> is a free jazz saxophonist that Sam and Smiley have been playing bass and drums for in the Rick Jensen Trio. We take pleasure in presenting "<a href="/albums/age-of-illumination">age of illumination</a>", recorded live at the Photospace, Wellington NZ in July 2003, with Rick playing clarinet and alto sax, <a href="/artists/tangent-precipitate">Sam</a> playing double bass, and Richard Whyte playing cello. We hope to see a lot of his work on the postmoderncore label in future.
