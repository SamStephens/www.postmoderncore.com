<p>
The promised first <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22cyberphobe%22">Cyberphobe</a> album has been released on the web. "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc033">during the year of my nervous breakdown</a>" is music about a society turning away from meaning.

The <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22phallus%22">Phallus</a> album, "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc034">deepthroated</a>", has been put on the postmoderncore catalogue and made available for download. Recorded from a live to air on Radio Massey five years ago, this Palmerston North trash/spazz rock album was originally released on <a href="http://www.lizardmull.com">Lizardmull Records</a>, Palmerston's own legendary swamp label... we still have copies...
