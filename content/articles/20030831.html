<p>
The promised first <a href="/artists/cyberphobe">Cyberphobe</a> album has been released on the web. "<a href="/albums/during-the-year-of-my-nervous-breakdown">during the year of my nervous breakdown</a>" is music about a society turning away from meaning.

<p>
The <a href="/artists/phallus">Phallus</a> album, "<a href="/albums/deepthroated">deepthroated</a>", has been put on the postmoderncore catalogue and made available for download. Recorded from a live to air on Radio Massey five years ago, this Palmerston North trash/spazz rock album was originally released on <a href="http://www.lizardmull.com">Lizardmull Records</a>, Palmerston's own legendary swamp label... we still have copies...
