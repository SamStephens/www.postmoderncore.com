<p>
The <a href="covergallery.html">cover gallery</a> is now online. This contains the cover art of the now 24 releases in the postmoderncore catalog. The whole of the <a href="/albums/disturbed-bits-010">Disturbed Bits series</a> is now available for download, and the albums that come after these are in the process of being uploaded. Also, I'm in the process of getting covers printed so that I will soon have some CDs to swap/sell/etc.</p>
