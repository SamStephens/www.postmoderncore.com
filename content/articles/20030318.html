<p>
Postmoderncore now has it's own domain, <a href="http://postmoderncore.com">postmoderncore.com</a> - update your links to the new location. The mp3s downloadable here are being switched to high quality, 192k bandwidth mp3s. In another month all the material on the label should be available from the site. And as all of this isn't free, we're now accepting donations to help keep the website going.
