It's lovely to have this release from [Toxic Chicken](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22toxic+chicken%22) for [Netlabel Day](http://www.netlabelday.com/).

A picture of the Unknown Rockstar drinking beer inspired Toxic Chicken to create [The Unknown Rockstar](/albums/the-unknown-rockstar), an album of sometimes fun and sometimes quite beautiful electronic music. Funky; a good time.

Toxic Chicken is the long running project of one Kai Nobuko. Toxic Chicken uses a craptop to create idiosyncratic, humorous and enchanting electronic music. Absurdist, experimental, but accessible.
