<p>PhotoChop exhibition opening, Bluebird Microcreamery the 12th of December, 7pm-10pm Pacific Time</p>
<p>A collective exhibition of collage images from print using photo chop, scissors, and glue. The exhibition salutes the dawn of photo lithography, the 120 year old tradition of processing images for the mass print medium... and giving the recycled images a montage of new meaning. Featuring over 20 artists.</p>
<p>Everything $5 - $100</p>
<p>Opening Thursday December 12 @ 7pm<br>
