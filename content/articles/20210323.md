[Unknown Rockstar](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22unknown+rockstar%22) has contributed a performance to this event coming up this weekend. All of Garrison's shows I've ever been to have been wonderful and off the wall, both in person and online. Recommended.

There's a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/213106312975461/), stream details will be posted to that event.
