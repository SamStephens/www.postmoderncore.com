<p>
John Billings from New It Make recently interviewed me about Postmoderncore, free culture, and a rambling bunch of other subjects. He even manages to make me sound vaguely coherent! You can <a href="http://newitmake.org.nz/en/podcasts/audio/show/35-episode-24-the-unknown-rockstar">download the interview from the New It Make site</a>. He uses clips of Postmoderncore music during the show, as well as his own remixes, which you can <a href="http://newitmake.org.nz/en/remix/all/audio">download in full from New Make It</a>.
