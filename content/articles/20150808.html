thumbnail_title: Unknown Rockstar on music without action

---
<p>I realize what it is I love about making music from feedback and the simmer of static and mains hum and overloaded loop pedals. It's the lack of control. There is no playing here. No master plan, no harmonic progression, no virtuosity. This music is an invocation, a ritual, an incantation. You set up strings and pedals and amps, and with the barest of activities offer your faith in sympathetic vibration, in your own judgement, in luck, in inevitability. - <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22unknown+rockstar%22">Unknown Rockstar</a>.</p>
