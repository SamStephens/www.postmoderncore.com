<li><a href="http://www.dadashopping.net/">The Doll</a> - "The Doll can be constituted by mixing 3 parts experiment, 4 parts noise, 1 part ritual, and 2 parts theatre, with a pinch of space dust." - Alt Music. "Using the crudest techniques imaginable, [The Doll] collages tapes of various known songs with the sounds of urination, faux-bells and various other crap, creating a truly messy m√©lange. Punker than you? Why, yes it is!" - Size Matters.</li>
