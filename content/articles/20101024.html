<p>I'm pleased to finally unveil the totally rebuilt Postmoderncore. The new site is easier to use and navigate than the old one, with a cleaner and more minimal aesthetic. It's now possible to listen to all the albums via a built-in streaming player, so you are no longer forced to download the albums in order to listen to them.</p>
<p>A number of updates will be forthcoming over the next few weeks. If you have any comments or issues, please contact me using the link above. I hope you enjoy the site</p>
