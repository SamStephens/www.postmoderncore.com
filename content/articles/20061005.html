At extremely short notice, <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22zombie+prom+queen%22">Zombie Prom Queen</a> have been invited to play at The Pit, the bar attached to <a href="http://www.bats.co.nz/">Bats Theatre</a>. This is one of the last gigs at The Pit before Richie moves on to his new, better, bigger bar, so come on down and rock out with us.
