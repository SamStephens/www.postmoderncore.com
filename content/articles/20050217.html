<p>
postmoderncore has recently appeared on two websites. Firstly it is featured site of the month on the <a href="http://www.oddiooverplay.com">Oddio Overplay</a> website. Oddio Overplay is a great website that links to free music of many sorts all over the internet. Secondly postmoderncore has just been mentioned on <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/39556">Metafilter</a>, a website that collects links to interesting sites.

Recently the <a href="about.html">postmoderncore about page</a> has been updated, with a better description of the label, it's origins, and it's objectives.

This is the first postmoderncore news for a while, because I have been very busy working in South Korea. I have just bought a computer, so now there should be more updates to postmoderncore, and some more releases in a couple of months.
