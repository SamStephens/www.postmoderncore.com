Cyberphobe is to be on a compilation "<a href="http://www.freespeechforsale.com">Free Speech For Sale</a>", from some of the same people as "<a href="http://www.droplift.org/">The Droplift Project</a>". From a press release - <i>"The theme of the CD is "text manipulation" made entirely from commercials. This is inspired from the record label Illegal Art, which released a CD called "Commercial Ad Hoc," with a similar theme, except the majority of the CD is compiled of recylced SOUNDS from commercials, not necessarily text, and the majority of the tracks do not project a message of any kind. I felt it would be cool to have a compilation which was along the same lines, but required the tracks consist of text-manipulation. After seeing Droplift, I then realized the appropriate means of distribution for such an animal....Droplift them! The causes behind this project are entirely the same...we need to get our art form heard and cannot do it legally if we sell it, so we must give it away."</i></p>
