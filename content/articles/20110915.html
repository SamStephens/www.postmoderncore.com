<p>Finally, another Unknown Rockstar album, <a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc065">Untouched Mind</a>. Hypnotic, dreamy, confrontational, complex - the album travels through many moods and styles. An assemblage of live parts, samples, treatments, field recordings and anything else that can make a complex organic composition like this work.</p>
