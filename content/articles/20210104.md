A new album by the [Unknown Rockstar](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22unknown+rockstar%22), [Endless and Unreal](/albums/endless-and-unreal). Sounds build and mutate from scritch and scree, squeak and clank, to intensity, rupture and roar, whilst maintaining their enigma and inscrutability.
