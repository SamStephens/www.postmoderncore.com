<p>
After a long time, I've finally began some more work on the postmoderncore online presence. "<a href="/albums/disturbed-bits-007">Disturbed Bits #007</a>" and "<a href="/albums/disturbed-bits-008">Disturbed Bits #008</a>" are now available for download. "<a href="/albums/disturbed-bits-009">Disturbed Bits #009</a>", "<a href="/albums/disturbed-bits-010">Disturbed Bits #010</a>", "<a href="/albums/within-the-range-of-hearing">within the range of hearing</a>" and "<a href="/albums/elevated-states-of-consciousness">elevated states of consciousness</a>" will be available from the <a href="/artists/tangent-precipitate">Tangent Precipitate</a> music page over the next while as the mp3s are uploaded. Also coming up should be some more material from Cyberphobe and some material from a new sampling project by Tangent Precipitate and Voodoo T Savage.</p>
