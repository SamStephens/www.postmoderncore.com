<p>
After a long time, I've finally began some more work on the postmoderncore online presence. "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc016">Disturbed Bits #007</a>" and "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc017">Disturbed Bits #008</a>" are now available for download. "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc018">Disturbed Bits #009</a>", "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc019">Disturbed Bits #010</a>", "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc021">within the range of hearing</a>" and "<a href="https://archive.org/details/pmc020">elevated states of consciousness</a>" will be available from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22tangent+precipitate%22">Tangent Precipitate</a> music page over the next while as the mp3s are uploaded. Also coming up should be some more material from Cyberphobe and some material from a new sampling project by Tangent Precipitate and Voodoo T Savage.</p>
