---
We're excited to released an album by [The Doll](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22the+doll%22). The Doll has been making no-fi sounds since 2004. She likes to augment her vocals with contact mics, balloons, magnetic tape, percussion junk, garbage from the side of the road, horns, household appliances, a T-Pain mic, & field recordings. She enjoys Cool Edit Pro on an XP craptop.

The Doll spent a year exploring the inner noiselife of the hand dryers and air blades that dwell in castles, cathedrals, pubs, venues, museums etc. [Hand Dryer Solos](/albums/hand-dryer-solos) is made from a selection of live recordings performed in public bathrooms for unsuspecting members of the No Audience Overground.

Recorded on a phone in the toilets of Wales and England, with a splash of Spain, Portugal & Romania for good measure.
