After seeing [a video of Unknown Rockstar playing at the Blue House](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMSJwYFySJz/), [Grey Cyphers](https://greycyphers.bandcamp.com) reached out
about a possible album. Now, they've released [Life Living](https://greycyphers.bandcamp.com/album/life-living).

> 'Life Living' is made up of 3 extended electric guitar excursions. Overall I guess it could be said that the record has something of a 'trippy' trajectory; Tracks 1 and 3 are explicitly Raga-esque in mode, blissed out warbly extemporising over a shruti drone. The middle track is a darker toned echo-fueled mindfuck that shifts one refreshingly off centre before we drift out to the familiar calm of of Raga 2.

Thanks to Grey Cyphers.
