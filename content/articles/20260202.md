I'm delighted to have [Toxic Chicken](https://archive.org/details/postmoderncore?sort=-date&and[]=creator%3A%22toxic+chicken%22) return for a second release with Postmoderncore. Toxic Chicken has been kind enough to describe the album for us:

> Inspired by the postmoderncore guitar improvisations of New Zealand's very own 'The Unknown Rockstar', your trusted chicken friend tried to pick up and play a guitar. But born with feathers instead of fingers, this attempt turned awful... Awfully good.. when playing it through a sampling keyboard instead. Add some other music elements on some fine evenings of jamming and voila: 'Ersatz Gat' was born. 
> 
> Pour yourself some tasty liquid of choice, stroke a cat or two, press play and chill out with these unusually long and intoxicating guitarish experiments. 

You can download the album from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/pmc093) or [Bandcamp](https://postmoderncore.bandcamp.com/album/ersatz-gat).
